# SlideForge Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementation of the SlideForge multi-agent presentation generation system, with focus on large document processing capabilities.

## Recent Activities
- Created complete project structure following the architecture plan
- Implemented database models for users, documents, extracted content, presentations, and jobs
- Set up Alembic for database migrations
- Implemented authentication with JWT
- Created API endpoints for documents, jobs, and presentations
- Implemented the three agent modules:
  - Extraction Agent for document processing
  - Generation Agent for slide creation
  - Optimization Agent for styling
- Implemented task orchestration system
- Created setup and run scripts
- **Enhanced the Extraction Agent with large document support:**
  - Implemented intelligent document chunking for PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
  - Created specialized strategies for extracting key content from documents of 100+ pages
  - Optimized LLM prompts for processing partial document content
  - Added structured metadata to maintain document context

## Current Status
The SlideForge system now has enhanced document processing capabilities, with real AI integration using OpenAI o3-mini and Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet models. The extraction agent can effectively process documents of arbitrary size, including those with 100+ pages, by intelligently extracting and analyzing the most important content sections. The system architecture follows the design with three specialized agents, a database for tracking state, and REST APIs for interacting with the system.

## Next Steps
- Create unit tests for large document processing
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Enhance the presentation generation with python-pptx
- Add more styling templates
- Implement a frontend client
- Set up production deployment configuration
- Add support for additional document formats (e.g., HTML, Markdown)
