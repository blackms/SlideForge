# SlideForge Active Context

## Current Focus
Architecture design and planning for the SlideForge multi-agent presentation generation system.

## Recent Activities
- Created project brief documentation
- Established Memory Bank structure
- Completed detailed architecture plan with:
  - Component diagrams showing the multi-agent system
  - Sequence diagrams for the workflow
  - Database schema design
  - API endpoint definitions
  - Deployment architecture
  - Implementation strategy

## Current Questions/Challenges
- Confirming if the architectural approach meets expectations
- Determining priority features for initial implementation
- Deciding on specific LLM models to use with LangChain
- Selecting the optimal task queue implementation (Celery vs alternatives)
- Planning the testing strategy for AI-based components

## Next Steps
- Review and refine the architecture plan based on feedback
- Create project scaffolding structure
- Define specific interfaces between agents
- Prepare for initial implementation
- Develop proof-of-concept for key components
