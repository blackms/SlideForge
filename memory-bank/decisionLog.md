## Initial Architectural Decisions

### [AD-001] - Multi-Agent Architecture Approach
- **Date**: 2025-03-04
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The system needs to perform distinct operations on document processing: extraction, slide generation, and graphic optimization.
- **Decision**: Implement a three-agent architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Single monolithic system
  - Two-agent system combining extraction and slide generation
  - Microservices with more granular components
- **Rationale**: 
  - The three-agent approach aligns naturally with the three main steps of the process
  - Allows for independent scaling of each agent based on workload
  - Enables specialized optimization for each phase of processing
  - Provides clear boundaries for development and testing
- **Consequences**:
  - Need for well-defined interfaces between agents
  - More complex orchestration than a monolithic approach
  - Potential for better maintenance and extension in the long term
- **Related Decisions**: AD-004 (Asynchronous Processing)

### [AD-002] - FastAPI as Backend Framework
- **Date**: 2025-03-04
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need for a high-performance API framework that supports modern Python features.
- **Decision**: Use FastAPI as the backend framework.
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Flask
  - Django
  - Starlette (directly)
- **Rationale**: 
  - FastAPI offers superior performance with async support
  - Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
  - Type checking with Pydantic
  - Modern Python features (3.7+) including async/await
- **Consequences**:
  - Team needs to be familiar with async programming patterns
  - Better API documentation and client generation
  - Performance benefits for concurrency-heavy operations
- **Related Decisions**: None

### [AD-003] - Database Strategy
- **Date**: 2025-03-04
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Need for a database solution that works well in development and can scale in production.
- **Decision**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production.
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - MongoDB or other NoSQL solutions
  - Direct SQL with no ORM
  - Single database for both environments
- **Rationale**: 
  - SQLAlchemy provides flexibility to switch database backends
  - SQLite simplifies development environment setup
  - PostgreSQL offers rich features and performance for production
  - Relational database suits the structured nature of our data
- **Consequences**:
  - Need to ensure compatibility between SQLite and PostgreSQL
  - Migration scripts must be tested against both databases
  - Additional configuration for environment switching
- **Related Decisions**: None

### [AD-004] - Asynchronous Task Processing
- **Date**: 2025-03-04
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Document processing and presentation generation can be time-consuming, requiring asynchronous processing.
- **Decision**: Implement asynchronous task queue using Celery or similar technology.
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Background threads within the application
  - Serverless functions
  - Direct synchronous processing
- **Rationale**: 
  - Task queues provide reliable background processing
  - Allows for horizontal scaling of workers
  - Provides monitoring and retry capabilities
  - Can handle long-running tasks without blocking API responses
- **Consequences**:
  - Additional infrastructure components (message broker, workers)
  - More complex deployment architecture
  - Better scalability and reliability for processing tasks
- **Related Decisions**: AD-001 (Multi-Agent Architecture)

### [AD-005] - Large Document Processing Strategy
- **Date**: 2025-03-04
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The system needs to handle documents of arbitrary size, including very large documents (100+ pages) that exceed token limits of LLMs.
- **Decision**: Implement intelligent document chunking with context-aware extraction that prioritizes key sections and representative samples.
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Simple truncation to fit token limits
  - Naive chunking with fixed-size segments
  - Using a summarization step before main processing
  - Limiting maximum document size
- **Rationale**: 
  - Strategic extraction preserves document meaning better than simple truncation
  - Document structure analysis helps identify the most important sections
  - Different document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT) require specialized extraction approaches
  - Maintaining introduction and conclusion provides better context for LLMs
- **Consequences**:
  - More complex document parsing logic
  - Better handling of large documents without arbitrary size limits
  - Slight processing overhead for document structure analysis
  - Superior presentation quality for large documents
  - Reduced token usage and processing costs
- **Related Decisions**: AD-001 (Multi-Agent Architecture)
